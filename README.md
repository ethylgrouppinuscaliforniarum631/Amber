## The Problem

ML training pipelines have no integrity guarantees. Model checkpoints — the most valuable artifacts in any training run — are stored as plain files with no protection against corruption, unauthorized modification, or silent degradation.

Existing experiment trackers (W&B, MLflow, DVC) log metadata about checkpoints. They do not enforce immutability. They do not detect anomalous weight changes. They do not automatically roll back when model quality regresses. They do not verify that the bytes on disk still match what was originally stored.

This creates a class of failures that are invisible until they cause damage:

- **Silent corruption** — bit rot, GPU memory errors during saves, filesystem-level corruption
- **Unauthorized modification** — automated agents, scripts, or tools modifying checkpoints without safeguards
- **Quality regression** — a training step produces worse weights but overwrites the previous checkpoint with no rollback mechanism
- **Provenance loss** — no cryptographic guarantee that a checkpoint was produced by a specific training run with specific configuration

In one documented case, an AI assistant given write access to a training pipeline deleted critical pathways from a verified 590M-parameter checkpoint, then fabricated the existence of a backup. The working model was permanently lost. No existing tool would have prevented this — the modification was a valid file write on an unprotected file.

Amber was built to make this class of failure impossible.

---

## How Amber Solves It

Amber is an immutable ledger for model checkpoints. Every version of every watched file is content-addressed, cryptographically hashed, compressed, and locked at the Linux kernel level. The system continuously monitors for anomalies, enforces quality gates, and can autonomously recover from failures — creating self-healing ML pipelines that protect their own integrity.

### Immutable Ledger

Every checkpoint stored in Amber is:

- **Content-addressed** — named by its SHA-256 hash, automatically deduplicated
- **Compressed** — zstd (level 3 for objects, level 9 for archives)
- **Kernel-locked** — platform-native immutability set immediately after write. No user-space process can modify or delete stored objects without passphrase-authenticated unlock
  - **Linux**: `FS_IMMUTABLE_FL` via `ioctl` (chattr +i)
  - **macOS**: `UF_IMMUTABLE` via `chflags` (chflags uchg)
  - **Windows**: read-only attribute + NTFS ACL deny write/delete
- **Chain-linked** — each version references its parent hash, forming a tamper-evident chain

### Anomaly Detection

```
Checkpoint write detected (inotify)
  -> Compare to previous version size
  -> If (new / previous) < threshold:
       FLAG anomaly
       Execute on_anomaly hooks (alerts, diagnostics)
       Preserve BOTH versions immutably
       Auto-sync anomalous version to safety mirrors
```

Write-storm detection automatically identifies active training runs and throttles snapshots to prevent disk thrash while still capturing progress at configurable intervals.

### Score-Gated Rollback

```bash
# Enforce: checkpoints must score >= 3/5 on ALU tests
# Auto-restore the last passing version if a new checkpoint fails
amber gate ./checkpoints --score-key ALU --min-score "3/5" --auto-rollback
```

Post-snapshot hooks can run your benchmark suite after every checkpoint write, tag the results as structured metadata, and the gate system automatically evaluates whether the new version meets quality thresholds. If it doesn't, Amber restores the last version that passed — no human intervention required.

### Integrity Verification

```bash
$ amber verify
Integrity check: 847/847 passed
All objects verified OK.
```

Every stored object is re-read from disk, decompressed, re-hashed, and compared against its content-addressed key. Delta-stored versions are fully reconstructed and verified against the original content hash. This catches silent bit rot, filesystem corruption, and any modification that bypassed the immutability layer.

---

## Self-Healing Pipeline

Amber's features combine into an automated self-healing loop:

```
Training produces checkpoint
  |
  +-- Amber stores immutably (SHA-256, zstd, chattr +i)
  |
  +-- Post-snapshot hooks run benchmark suite
  |     |
  |     +-- Results tagged as metadata: ALU=5/5, loss=0.031
  |
  +-- Gate evaluates: score >= threshold?
  |     |
  |     +-- YES: checkpoint accepted, training continues
  |     +-- NO:  auto-rollback to last passing version
  |              anomaly flagged, hooks fire alerts
  |
  +-- Anomaly detector watches for file shrink
  |     |
  |     +-- Normal: proceed
  |     +-- Shrink detected: flag, alert, preserve both versions
  |
  +-- Mirror sync: anomalous versions -> USB/remote
  +-- Remote push: rsync to backup server
  +-- Integrity verification: periodic re-hash of all objects
```

The pipeline heals itself. Bad checkpoints get rolled back. Corrupted files get flagged. Verified working versions are immutable. The training run continues from the last known-good state.

### Hook Integration

```toml
[hooks]
# Run benchmark after every checkpoint, tag result
post_snapshot = [
    "python3 benchmark.py --checkpoint $AMBER_FILE --out /tmp/score.txt && amber tag $AMBER_FILE --version $AMBER_VERSION --key score --value $(cat /tmp/score.txt)"
]

# Alert on anomalous checkpoint changes
on_anomaly = [
    "echo '[AMBER] Anomaly: $AMBER_FILE shrunk to ${AMBER_SHRINK_RATIO}x' >> /var/log/training-alerts.log"
]
```

Environment variables available to hooks: `$AMBER_FILE`, `$AMBER_VERSION`, `$AMBER_HASH`, `$AMBER_SIZE`, `$AMBER_ANOMALY`, `$AMBER_SHRINK_RATIO`, `$AMBER_PREV_SIZE`.

### Remote Backup

# USB mirror (anomalous versions auto-sync when drive connected)
amber mirror add /media/usb --mode flagged --auto --bundle
```

---

## Architecture

```
amber-core/        Core library — 17 modules, ~3500 lines of Rust
  storage.rs        Content-addressed immutable object store
  lock.rs           FS_IMMUTABLE_FL kernel ioctls + Argon2 passphrase
  hash.rs           SHA-256 hashing + object-key sharding
  engine.rs         Write-storm detection + anomaly flagging
  gate.rs           Score parsing + automated rollback
  hooks.rs          Pre/post-snapshot hook execution
  delta.rs          bsdiff binary delta compression
  manifest.rs       Append-only bincode version manifests
  snapshot.rs       VersionEntry + CheckpointMeta + HookResult
  session.rs        Gap-based session grouping
  archive.rs        Session collapsing into tar.zst bundles
  remote.rs         rsync remote backup
  mirror.rs         USB mirror sync (flagged/watched/all)
  search.rs         Full-text search across version history
  git.rs            Auto-capture git commit labels
  config.rs         TOML configuration
  ipc.rs            Binary serde daemon protocol

amber-daemon/      Async file-watching daemon (tokio + inotify + Unix socket IPC)
amber-cli/         CLI + TUI interface (clap + ratatui)
```

### Immutable Ledger Layout

```
~/.amber/store/
  objects/<xx>/<hash>       Content blobs — zstd compressed, FS_IMMUTABLE_FL locked
  deltas/<xx>/<hash>        Binary delta patches — zstd compressed, locked
  manifests/<uuid>.bin      Append-only version chains per watched path
  archives/<uuid>.tar.zst   Collapsed historical sessions
```

Every object is named by its SHA-256 hash. Duplicates are impossible. Modifications are impossible without kernel-level unlock. The manifest forms a hash-linked chain — any tampering breaks the chain and is detectable by `amber verify`.

### Event Flow

```
File modification (inotify)
  |
  +-- SmartEngine: training mode? -> throttle to interval snapshots
  +-- SmartEngine: anomaly? -> flag + alert hooks
  |
  +-- Pre-snapshot hooks -> abort if any fail
  |
  +-- SHA-256 hash -> dedup check
  +-- Store: full copy or bsdiff delta (by size threshold)
  +-- Kernel lock: FS_IMMUTABLE_FL via ioctl
  |
  +-- Post-snapshot hooks -> benchmark, tag metadata
  +-- Gate evaluation -> rollback if score below threshold
  |
  +-- Git commit capture
  +-- Session tracking
  +-- Mirror sync (connected + auto)
  +-- Remote push (configured + auto)
```

## Regulatory Compliance

The EU AI Act (2026) mandates audit trails and version control for high-risk AI systems. Amber provides:

- **Immutable audit chain** — every checkpoint stored with SHA-256 hash, UTC timestamp, and parent link
- **Tamper evidence** — kernel-level immutability flags; any bypass is detectable
- **Integrity verification** — `amber verify` re-hashes every stored object on demand
- **Provenance metadata** — training script hash, config hash, GPU ID, training duration
- **Retention guarantees** — archive system preserves first, last, anomalous, and labelled versions

---

## Requirements

- **Linux** — `FS_IMMUTABLE_FL` via ioctl (ext4, xfs, btrfs)
- **macOS** — `UF_IMMUTABLE` via chflags (APFS, HFS+)
- **Windows** — read-only attribute + NTFS ACL deny write/delete
- Falls back gracefully on unsupported filesystems — versioning works, immutability is skipped
- **Rust 1.70+** for building from source
- **rsync** (optional) for remote backup

## Tests

```bash
cargo test    # 42 tests — hashing, deltas, storage, manifests, sessions, engine, gating, e2e
```

## MCP Server — AI Agent Integration

Amber includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants direct access to checkpoint protection and context management. The tool built because an AI destroyed model weights — now integrated into AI assistants so they protect checkpoints instead of destroying them.

### Setup

```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

Add to your Claude Code settings (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amber": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/Amber/amber-mcp/amber_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
